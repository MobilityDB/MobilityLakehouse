# TemporalParquet specification

TemporalParquet is the open file format of the MobilityLakehouse: a Parquet
footer-metadata convention, modelled directly on [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/),
that makes MobilityDB temporal columns self-describing and portable. A file is
plain Parquet — readable by any Parquet tool — and carries enough metadata for
any engine to reconstruct the temporal values without a MobilityDB installation.

## File structure

Each column carrying a temporal type is a `BYTE_ARRAY` (logical type `NONE`);
each row value is the MEOS-WKB encoding of the temporal value, and nulls are
Parquet nulls. The encoding is the MEOS C library's battle-tested WKB; this
spec defines the metadata, not the bytes.

The Parquet file's `key_value_metadata` carries a `temporal` key whose value is
a JSON document describing each temporal column. It coexists with GeoParquet's
`geo` key — a single file may have both.

```jsonc
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "primary_temporal_column": "traj",
  "columns": {
    "traj": {
      "encoding": "MEOS-WKB",
      "encoding_version": "1.0",
      "base_type": "tgeompoint",
      "subtype": "Sequence",
      "interpolation": "linear",
      "srid": 4326,
      "geodetic": false,
      "has_z": false
    }
    /* one entry per temporal column */
  }
}
```

## Type coverage

| Type | `base_type` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tbool`, `tint`, `tfloat`, `tbigint`, `ttext` | each as itself | scalar temporals |
| `tgeompoint`, `tgeogpoint` | `tgeompoint` / `tgeogpoint` | spatial-temporal; `srid` + `geodetic` + `has_z` populated |
| `tgeometry`, `tgeography` | `tgeometry` / `tgeography` | general spatial-temporal |
| `th3index` | `th3index` | spatial via `h3_resolution` |
| `tpcpoint`, `tpcpatch` | each as itself | temporal point-cloud types |
| `tcbuffer`, `tnpoint`, `tpose`, `trgeometry` | each as itself | extended temporal types |
| `stbox`, `tbox`, `tpcbox` | each as itself | bounding boxes |
| spans, spansets, sets | each as itself | time/value ranges and sets |

`subtype` (`Instant` / `Sequence` / `SequenceSet`) applies only to lifted
temporal types; span/set/box columns omit it.

### Optional self-describing fields

These let a consumer decide whether a column is usable for a workload **without
decoding any row**:

| Field | Applies to | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `srid` | spatial-temporal types | EPSG code of the column's CRS |
| `geodetic` | `tgeogpoint`, `tgeography` | `true` ⇒ spheroidal-metre math |
| `has_z` | spatial-temporal types | column carries a Z dimension |
| `h3_resolution` | `th3index` | resolution `[0,15]` every cell was produced at |

## Encoding versioning

`encoding_version` is `MAJOR.MINOR` of the WKB schema. New WKB tags bump MINOR;
breaking layout changes bump MAJOR. Readers must refuse a file whose MAJOR
exceeds what they support.

## Geodetic distances

`tgeompoint` stores coordinates in the input CRS and computes **Euclidean**
distances in that coordinate space — `length()` over a WGS-84 trajectory
returns degrees, not metres. `tgeogpoint` carries the same MEOS-WKB bytes with
the geodetic flag set, routing all spatial math through the spheroidal engine —
lengths and speeds in **metres**.

For distance or speed analytics, prefer `tgeogpoint` (`"geodetic": true`). The
geodetic flag is self-describing in MEOS-WKB: a file written with
`asBinary(tgeogpointSeq(...))` reconstructs as a geodetic sequence on any engine
that calls `tgeogpointFromBinary(blob)`.

## Covering columns

Alongside the value column, a TemporalParquet writer materialises primitive
**covering columns** — `xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax[/zmin/zmax]`, `tmin/tmax`, `srid`
for spatial types; `vmin/vmax`, `tmin/tmax` for numeric types. These give the
Parquet/Iceberg engine min/max statistics for row-group and manifest pruning.
See [covering-columns.md](https://github.com/MobilityDB/MobilityLakehouse/blob/main/spec/covering-columns.md).

A column's covering is declared in `temporal`, in the shape GeoParquet 1.1 uses
for `covering.bbox`: a mapping from each bound to the column that carries it, so
a consumer finds the columns by reading the metadata rather than by guessing
their names.

```jsonc
"traj": {
  "encoding": "MEOS-WKB",
  "base_type": "tgeompoint",
  "covering": {
    "bbox": {
      "xmin": ["traj_bbox", "xmin"], "ymin": ["traj_bbox", "ymin"],
      "xmax": ["traj_bbox", "xmax"], "ymax": ["traj_bbox", "ymax"],
      "tmin": ["traj_bbox", "tmin"], "tmax": ["traj_bbox", "tmax"]
    }
  }
}
```

The mapping is GeoParquet's, with `tmin` and `tmax` beside the spatial bounds.
It is declared here rather than in `geo` because `covering` is a member of a
*geometry* column's metadata there, and a temporal column is not a geometry
column — see [conformance.md](https://github.com/MobilityDB/MobilityLakehouse/blob/main/spec/conformance.md)
for the rules that govern the two keys living in one file.

Carrying the time bounds in the same structure is the smallest useful extension
of GeoParquet's own vocabulary, and it is offered as such: were `covering.bbox`
to admit `tmin` and `tmax`, a spatial-and-temporal pruning predicate would be
expressible in GeoParquet itself, additively and compatibly with every file
already written.

## Relationship to the lakehouse

TemporalParquet is the open **lake** substrate: plain files, no catalog
required. The **lakehouse** layer registers those files as Apache Iceberg
tables, where the covering columns become Iceberg column statistics and the
catalog prunes whole files before reading. The format is unchanged by Iceberg —
the same files work with or without a catalog.
